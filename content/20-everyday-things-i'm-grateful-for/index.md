1.  Licking the cappuccino foam when it’s over. It’s the best part of it.
2.  Having the chance to eat my lunch in the park whenever it’s sunny.
3.  Every time I give myself a hard time, I have friends who are always there to tell me I’m being a dumbass.
4.  Always having a good book at hand to read. In fact, for being able to read anything anywhere! Go eBooks.
5.  Being fit and healthy enough to do exercise weekly, with no big constraints.
6.  My indulgence of a daily square of really dark chocolate after lunch (alright, sometimes two).
7.  Having a job that mostly allows me to listen to music while working. In fact, it probably makes me better at doing it.
8.  Writing, in paper, or digitally. For being able to appreciate words and letters everyday.
9.  Not having to worry about money for the most part of my everyday life.
10.  Having traveled around a bit and compiled many travel stories.
11.  For being able to enjoy and take comfort on the sound of the rain while falling asleep.
12.  For hot, steamy green tea with cinnamon after dinner. 
13.  For being brought up in a loving environment, with parents that couldn’t have loved me more, even when I acted ungrateful as a son.
14.  I’m grateful for hugs, and the never ending pursuit for more of them.
15.  For walking. Everywhere, anywhere, especially with a camera on my bag.
16.  Every time someones cooks or bakes something for me.
17.  To have been born in a country where I never had to deal with war, famine, or even natural disasters. 
18.  For having had people giving me good music and good movies very early in life. It shaped who I am and it opened my heart and mind.
19.  For Seinfeld and his teachings on finding humor in the little things of daily life.
20.  For always being curious about new and interesting things to do in life. Meditation, yoga, climbing… I’m grateful for being surrounded with a positive mindset to explore more and more.
