You’ve asked yourself this question too. 

When do you know that you’ve become a _Grown Up_™? You might have been 7 years old, or maybe you were 18, when you first asked yourself when you’d _just_ _know_. A few of us thought adulthood would start as soon as one hit 30 years of age, or maybe as soon as we got married. Maybe when we’d have a kid. Like many of us, I remember being very young and fearing never being capable of making the switch into adulthood. 

> “When does the switch flip?”

I’d try to project and fake adult-like feelings into my future self, imagining how it would feel like to make this transition: from a silly little guy to a fully grown, confident, has-its-shit-together-definitely-an-adult version of myself. Of course, there is no single checkpoint that defines such a moment of transition; nor do we ever fully grow out of being a kid, either, no, it’s a lot more subtle and complicated than that.

As I often struggle with these feelings again, just beyond that age of _proper adulthood_ as I had defined it in my teens, I can’t help but wonder about adulthood again. Not surprisingly, it’s only when I look at others around me and my relationship with them that I finally begin to see some clues. For example, having a friend is no longer _just_ a relationship, but also a responsibility. Being part of the world in my usual silent and passive way is no longer enough, as deep cravings for teaching and passing on knowledge ensue. I ignore these cravings, but they won’t go away. I listen again, and sure enough, there they are.

When thinking about what’s most pressing to pass on as knowledge, what’s most compelling to teach, I realise those are the things I’ve also learned the hard way, somehow. The lessons I find myself preaching, and quietly for the most part, are also the ones I needed, badly, at one point or another.

**We, then, feel the responsibility to teach the lessons we need or needed the most**. Maybe as continuous gentle reminders for ourselves, so we don’t lose our path, maybe for the sake of easing the pain of others. Maybe both. It’s this responsibility to show up for the world that defined my flip switch into adulthood. Perhaps more of an awakening rather than a transition, sure, and I’m not sure about what kind of shape it’s taking just yet.
