Japanese houses are worth absolutely nothing when they’re on the second hand market. That’s why the typical building in Japan lasts less than 30 years, while in American it’s more than 100: the recycling culture in Japan is just too overwhelming. No house is ever re-used, even if it’s rebuilt to look just like it did before.

It may have been due to the earthquake mentality of previous times: houses weren’t just expected to be sturdy enough to withstand one, so people always wanted to build new ones with better standards.
