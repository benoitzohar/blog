## A character for your thoughts

How many moleskins and notepads have you bought in the last year?

And how many of those have you used until their very last page? How many pages did you leave blank before you bought the one you currently have?

My own answers to these questions are shameful, at best. I don’t write or doodle nearly as much as I should, yet I keep buying moleskins because I find one in the shop that looks prettier than the current one, only to eventually misplace every single one of them in places I never remember to check again. I’m the inventor of the moleskin graveyard.

As a writer then, my habits are rather dreadful. And yet, few activities in this planet give me as much pleasure, confidence, control over my own thoughts and an overall sense of _“connectedness” with the world_ as putting down words on a couple pieces of paper.

This week I flew from London to visit my parents, back in Porto. While browsing through my old possessions today back at their house, I stumbled across a small notepad that looked vaguely familiar. I picked it up and flipped through it, only about _1/4_ of it had been used. The handwriting was squiggly and rushed, but it was mine alright. I had no memory of writing such words.

#### And then I realized what that notepad contained: a diary of my experiences while backpacking around Europe six years ago.

You’d think something of that importance would always be kept in a safe, sacred place, probably even beside your most treasured values, like your first love letter or your first grade class photo. Well, you’d be right, except that I’m really **that** bad when it comes to safely storing and keeping my memories.

Reading through those pages, I was nothing short of blown away when I realized just **how many** stories and small details I had completely forgotten from those four weeks when I first got to see the world:

The feelings that I experienced on my very first plane trip, writing that _I would much rather be rolling down the Kilimanjaro naked than being on a tuna can with wings_. Or how silly I felt washing my clothes in the ocean  
by **Marseille**, when we crashed a summer beach rave. How I really wanted to talk to the gorgeous italian brunette that sat by our side in Pisa, but never really had the guts to do it. I had even forgotten about the Americans we met in Munich, that just kept me buying beer as they eagerly listened to our stories. That was my first proper hangover too, by the way. And I had completely forgotten about it until today.

Fast forward six years to this very moment, as I find myself on a plane again, I am paying my debt and respect for this sweet relationship between words and memories so I can find them sometime in the future and remember about this week: how I surprised my parents by flying unannounced, to remember their faces of _ohhh!_ when I showed up by the doorstep, how my mother hugged me so tight that felt like she was making sure I wasn’t the ghost of her son. I certainly gave them a different Thursday night.

Writing then, is not only a way of making sure you don’t forget. Writing is connecting the dots between the tactile experiences of the world and what’s processed by your heart. Writing is easy and also extremely hard; we can choose to hide our feelings in double meaning, or we can simply carve the facts in stone.

Anger, love, fear, excitement, these are all feelings that are transported by only a few milliliters of ink that are connecting your body and the paper. It’s just like oil pipelining, but with emotional liquid instead.

I’ll try and finish that notepad now.
